# CLI-OpenAI
This is a task to replicate ChatGPT into our Terminal and take all calls from there. This should be a simple API Invocation to OpenAI ChatGPT API. Our task is to avoid logging in and use ChatGPT Directly from our terminal.

To run this program, you'll need to set the CHATGPT_TOKEN environment variable to your ChatGPT API key. You can then build and run the program:

go build
CHATGPT_TOKEN=your_api_key ./chatgpt

# Exit the CLI

Give Input = exit
